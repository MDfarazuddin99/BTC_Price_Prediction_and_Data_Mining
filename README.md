# Contributions 

# Objective 
Bitcoin(BTC) is a decentralized digital currency that can be transferred on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network. BTC transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in public distributed ledger called blockchain.
The accurate prediction of bitcoin price can not only provide decision support for investors but also provide reference for the government to formulate regulatory policies.
Our aim is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the Bitcoin Prices Data and build, develop and test models to perform price prediction.

# About Dataset

Date: date of the record (Sequential Data) (Feature Variable).

Open: the opening price, the price at which an asset, in this case, Bitcoin, trades at the beginning of the day. (USD) (Feature Variable).

High: the maximum price of the day, the highest price reached by Bitcoin on that day, (USD) (Feature Variable).

Low: the minimum price of the day, the lowest price reached by the Bitcoin on that day, (USD) (Feature Variable).

Close: the closing price, the price at which Bitcoin trades at the end of the day, (USD) (Target Variable).

Volume: the sum of actual trades made during the day, (USD)(Feature Variable).

Market Cap: market capitalization, the total value of all shares of a company(Feature Variable).

# Models Tested

1. Statistical Models

      a. Auto Regressive Model Time Series data set
  
      b. Moving Average Model Time Series data set
  
      c. Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average Time series data set
  
2. KNN Model to predict the closing price using the Trends from other Major Cryptocurrency

3. Random Forest to predict the closing price using the Trends from other Major Cryptocurrency

4. Gradient Boosting to predict the closing price using the Trends from other Major Cryptocurrency

5. LSTM(Long Short Term Memory)
